    <p>
      Qal`at al-Bahrain is a typical tell an artificial mound created by many
      successive layers of human occupation. The strata spreads over a 180,000
      sq ft (16,723 m2) area, which encompasses the tell. This testifies to a
      continuous human presence from about 2300 BC to the 16th century AD. About
      25% of the site has been excavated revealing structures of different
      types:residential, public, commercial, religious and military. They
      testify to the importance of the site as a trading port over the
      centuries. On the top of the 12-metre-high (39 ft) mound, there is the
      impressive Qal`at al-Burtughal (Portuguese fort), which gave the whole
      site its name, qal`a, meaning "fort". As the site was the capital of the
      Dilmun civilisation, it contains the richest remains of this civilization,
      which was hitherto only known from written Sumerian references.The site
      contains many areas and walls, including Saar necropolis, Al-Hajjar
      necropolis, Kassite Palace, Madimat Hermand necropolis, Madimat Isa
      necropolis, Al-Maqsha Necropolis, Palace of Uperi, Shakhura necropolis,
      and the Northern city wall.The ruins of the Copper Age consists of two
      sections of the fortification wall surrounding streets and houses, and a
      colossal building on the edge of the moat of the Portuguese fort in the
      centre.Barbar pottery has been unearthed around the walls of the central
      building, dating back to the same age as the Barbar Temples, although some
      of the other pottery and range of unearthed artefacts indicated that they
      predated the temples, dating back to 3000 BC or later.Relics of copper and
      ivory provide an insight into ancient trade links.Many vessels have been
      unearthed on the site, and Danish excavations of the Palace of Uperi area
      revealed "snake bowls", sarcophagi, seals and a mirror, among other
      things.
